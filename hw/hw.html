				   Introducing the country’s most advanced Access Control System.
			  </h3>
			  
			  <div>
				  <p>
					 Employees, staff, clients, deliverymen, couriers… these days, it’s hard to keep track of people on your premises. Security guards do their best to check records and credentials, but there’s always a chance of a security breach. With so many people coming and going, restricted areas can be easily accessed, important documents and material copied and goods and expensive equipment can be stolen. What’s more, guards and people can even be bribed to let an unauthorised person enter.
		To make matters worse, shift duties add to the confusion. And valuable man-hours are spent on registers, records and overall attendance.
		The need of the hour is a system that grants access to only authorised personnel. A system that’s intelligent enough to differentiate one employee from the other, add layers of access control and even track and monitor attendance.
		Ceasefire brings you just a system – the Ceasefire Access Control System, the most advanced in the country.

					Why Ceasefire Access Control

					  At Ceasefire, we believe in looking into the future and being in control. Looking every threat in the eye and producing a weapon so powerful and advanced, it wipes out every trace of danger. Because we believe that if nothing is left to chance, nothing can possibly go wrong.
		Which is why we’ve designed the Ceasefire Access Control System - a system that allows you full control. Produced to our exacting standards in terms of quality, design and performance, in some of the world’s leading manufacturing facilities, this top-of-the-line range is a system like no other.
		It’s designed to present trespassers with complex layers of security they haven’t even heard of, much less experienced. From password and PIN protected doors to biometric ID restricted areas, the Access Control System guarantees complete protection. In other words, it chooses who can gain access and who can’t, while performing all the duties of a time-keeper, attendance monitor and salary manager. It records, tracks and reports 24x7.

					How the Ceasefire Access Control System works.
			   </h3>

			   </figure>
			   
			   <div>  
					<p>
					   An access control point can be a door, turnstile, parking gate, elevator, or other physical barrier where granting access can be electronically controlled.
	Access control can contain several elements. At its most basic, is a standalone electric lock, which is unlocked by an operator with a switch. To automate this, operator intervention is replaced by a reader. Readers could be a keypad where a code is entered, a card reader, or a biometric reader. Readers then send the card number to an access control panel that verifies the number against an access list.
	To monitor the door position, magnetic door switches are used. Generally only entry is controlled. In cases where the exit is also controlled, a second reader is installed on the other side of the door. In cases where exit is not controlled, a device called request-to- exit (RTE) is used. Request-to-exit devices can be a push-button or a motion detector. When the button is pushed or the motion detector detects motion at the door, the door alarm is temporarily ignored while the door is opened.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						All access door hardware is connected directly to intelligent or semi-intelligent readers. Readers usually do not make access decisions, and forward all requests to the main controller.
	Only in the event that the connection to the main controller is unavailable, the readers use their internal database to make access decisions and record events. Semi-intelligent readers that have no database and cannot function without the main controller should be used only in areas that do not require high security. Main controllers usually support 16 to 64 readers.
	The Ceasefire Access Control System also makes for the perfect attendance record-keeper. Loaded with face recognition, access card entry and supreme SFM fingerprint modules designed to provide biometric security, the Ceasefire Access Control System gives a powerful verification performance that wipes out the possibility for any proxy attendances. Also, with its easy integration with various other external databases, other functions like work-hour calculation and salary calculation become an easy task.
